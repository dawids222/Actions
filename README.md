# Actions
An application for monitoring daily contribution to certain activities. The main purpose is to measure progress in chosen areas of life. For example, if you are a smoker and want to quit, that could be a way to control yourself. You can input how many cigarettes you smoke every day for some time and then check on a graph how it goes.

Application capabilities:
* Creating categories (eg. smoking, riding a bike, learning, etc..)
* Logging daily contribution to a category (eg. on 21/12/2019 2h of learning)
* Visualization (every category can be shown on a graph)
* Save Graph (graph can be saved as a photo in a gallery)
* Notifications (user can set up notifications not to forget about logging daily contribution)

Actions is a fun, non commercial project, done mostly for myself.
Things I learned during this project:
* Room Persistence Library
* Lifecycle Library
* Android MVVM architecture (data binding, etc..)
* Notifications
* Material design 
* Dexter (permissions management library)(Uber useful <3)
* MPAndroidChart (chart library)
